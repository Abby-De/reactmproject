              After working as Technical leads in numerous firms, our founders
              noticed that bad hire plays a significant role of projects missing
              deadlines and milestones. When this happens, the reputation and
              integrity of the project team suffers and the pressure from
              project leads to deliver on time creates frustrations from high
              performing developers & engineers which leads them to leave
              prematurely.
            </p>

            <p>
              Most of the technical resources were hired either based on
              references or the hiring manager’s intuition. On average, $400 is
              spent on every candidate that is being interview. The initial
              interview rounds are not clear enough to gauge whether a candidate
              is a good fit or not.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the number of wrong candidates being hired keeps on increasing,
              firms often start missing project deadlines and milestones. Then
              additional resources are hired to meet deadlines, and the
              project's budget exceeds the limit.

              We decided the best way to fix this issue was to focus intensively
              on understanding the technical challenges our client’s team is
              facing then customize the hiring process and assessments based on
              the client's requirements. Consequently, in September 2019 Brackit
              Business Solutions, Inc. was established.
